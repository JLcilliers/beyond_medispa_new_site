Medik8 is a scientifically advanced British skincare brand renowned for creating some of the most effective, gentle professional peels available. Our Medik8 peel treatments are specifically customized to address the unique skincare challenges faced by Edinburgh residents, from weather-related dullness and dehydration to uneven texture and pigmentation concerns. These medical-grade chemical peels use precise concentrations of active ingredients like lactic acid, salicylic acid, mandelic acid, and glycolic acid to gently dissolve the bonds between dead skin cells, revealing the fresh, radiant skin beneath. Unlike harsh traditional peels, Medik8 formulations are designed to resurface while simultaneously hydrating and soothing, making them suitable even for sensitive skin types. Each treatment is fully customizable to your specific concerns, whether you're targeting fine lines, acne, hyperpigmentation, enlarged pores, or overall skin dullness. Our experienced practitioners in Edinburgh's New Town provide thorough consultations to select the ideal peel strength and formulation for your skin, ensuring optimal results with minimal downtime.
